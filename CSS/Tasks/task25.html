  <title>Gallery Layout with Flexbox</title>
</head>
<body>

<!-- Design Instructions:

1. Create a parent container with class name 'gallery'.
2. Use Flexbox on the gallery container: set `display: flex`.
3. Apply a combined property `flex-flow: row wrap` to lay out items in a row and allow wrapping to the next line if space is insufficient.
4. Set spacing between rows using `row-gap: 20px` and between columns using `column-gap: 20px`.
5. Inside the gallery, create 5 child divs with the class name 'photo'. Each one should contain a number from 1 to 5.
6. Set a fixed height (e.g., 100px) and fixed width (e.g., 30% of the container) for each photo box to maintain a uniform layout.
7. Center the text inside each photo both vertically and horizontally using `display: flex`, `align-items: center`, and `justify-content: center`.
8. Apply a visible background color (e.g., lightcoral) to each photo to make them stand out.
9. Set the text color to white and increase the font size to around 24px for visibility.
10. Ensure the layout is responsiveâ€”on smaller screens, boxes should wrap neatly to the next row without overflowing.
